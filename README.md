Access to and frequency of healthcare services are critical issues, as they serve as indicators not only of the population's health but also of the factors that contribute to its utilization. Various factors can influence the frequency of hospital or healthcare center visits, including demographic and socioeconomic aspects, as well as health-related issues and insurance coverage. These determinants are crucial for policymakers aiming to optimize healthcare resources, improve accessibility, and address inequalities in medical care.

This study focuses on analyzing the factors that determine the number of hospital visits among individuals aged 66 and older. By examining variables such as health status, number of chronic conditions, age, gender, income, and insurance coverage, this work aims to provide insights into the patterns and predictors of hospital utilization.

The analysis in this project is based on the 'NMES1988' dataset from the 'AER' package. This dataset includes data from the US National Medical Expenditure Survey (1987â€“1988) concerning individuals aged 66 and older who were admitted to healthcare facilities, making it an ideal resource for exploring the factors associated with healthcare utilization in this age group.

Specifically, this project **aims** to:

1. Analyze the relationship between individual characteristics (including health status, chronic conditions, age, and gender) and the frequency of hospital visits. /n
2. Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and visually aid the understanding of the distribution of hospital visits among the elderly population. /n
3. Develop and implement a Poisson regression model to quantify the effects of these various factors on the frequency of hospital visits
